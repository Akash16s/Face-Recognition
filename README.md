# Face-Recognition and attendence
Learned and implemented the Face recognition using face_recognition api

# Attendence
Using face recognition api, self implemented algo in SceneChangeDetect.py and Multithreading pool developed a system in which one can pass argument as past cctv footage and can do facial_recognition(attendence).

# Processing Speed: 
50sec(changes rapid) -> 13 sec processing and largely depends upon the visual it is getting as it skips most of the part of frame in which no change occured and also no face detected.
